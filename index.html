    <p id="quote">Through his soulful music, Nujabes has touched so many people around the world, even beyond his dreams. He was a mysterious character to most as he avoided the public limelight... Yet it continued to amaze me how young listeners of all backgrounds learned of his enigmatic name, and expressed support for his music.</p>
